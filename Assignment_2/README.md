###Code parts:
 The code is separated into two parts:partB and partC.
 There is the Data folder which is used to gain access to the datasets necessary in order to work with the data
###How to run the code:
 In order to install the requirements necessary to run the code you must first run the following command:
 ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
 
 Once the requirements are installed you should be able to run the entire NLP assignment using PartB as the main class, since partC requires partB be executed first.
